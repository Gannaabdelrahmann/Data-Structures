# Data-Structures üöÄ

This repository contains multiple C++ projects focused on implementing core data structures and algorithms. Each project demonstrates practical applications of concepts like linked lists, heaps, and binary search trees.

## üìÅ Contents

### 1. **Priority-Based Print Job Queue System**
A simulation of a printing system that uses **priority queues** to handle print jobs. Jobs with higher priority are printed first.

- **Key Concepts:** Priority Queues, Structs, Job Scheduling

### 2. **Custom String Manipulation System**
A string editor using a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** to perform various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal efficiently.

- **Key Concepts:** Doubly Linked List, String Parsing

### 3. **FCAI Task Manager**
A more complex project housed in its own folder. It implements a task manager using:

- `main.cpp`: The main logic for the task manager
- `heap.h`: A max/min heap structure for task prioritization
- `bst.h`: A Binary Search Tree for task search and organization

- **Key Concepts:** Heap, Binary Search Tree, Task Scheduling, OOP
